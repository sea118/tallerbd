      "Resumen: The woolly poplar aphid, Phloeomyzus passerinii, causes severe damage to poplars in Southern Europe and Asia, where outbreaks of this pest can lead to massive mortality of trees in mature stands. In Chile, this aphid was reported for the first time in 1997 in plantations of Populus nigra. During April 2016 and again in March 2017 (autumn season), several mycosed individuals were found attached to the poplars twigs. The fungus was identified as a Neozygites species by its characteristic morphology with subglobose primary conidia, 19.8 +/- 0.4 x 16.1 +/- 0.4 mu m, with a small, flat papilla, produced on the surface of cadavers, and capilliconidia that are almond shaped but rarely observed, 21.7 +/- 0.8 x 14.4 +/- 0.6 mu m. The resting spores were subglobose, 26.3 +/- 0.5 x 21.2 +/- 0.5 mu m, black in mass, with a thick more or less smooth-surfaced wall, and formed inside the aphid. Neozygites comprises a relatively homogeneous group of species exclusively pathogenic to arthropods. Their narrow host ranges make them potentially valuable biocontrol agents. This is the first report worldwide of any Neozygites on P. passerinii. \n",

      "Resumen: Reproductive cycles were studied in seven natural populations of the intertidal bivalve Perumytilus purpuratus, distributed in a latitudinal gradient of similar to 2400 km along the Chilean Pacific coast (20-40 degrees S). The results, both qualitative (gametogenic stages) and quantitative (GSI and GVF), over a period of 24 months, showed that these populations presented asynchrony in the reproductive cycle. Semi-annual cycles in Iquique (20 degrees S), Antofagasta (23 degrees S) and Montemar (32 degrees S), and annual cycles in Caleta Bolfin (23 degrees S), Taltal (25 degrees S), Tumbes (36 degrees S) and Pucatrihue (40 degrees S) (2010 - 2012) were found. The results indicate that latitude does not have an effect on the development stage, but it does on the spawning date. However, there is a relationship between the reproductive cycles and temperature fluctuations. In addition, there was a significant negative linear correlation between gonadosomatic index and sea surface temperature in the populations studied. The decrease in temperature reduces the rate of development stages and, therefore, increases the reproductive cycles from semi-annual to annual, as evidenced in bivalve samples from Taltal, along a semi-decadal period (2007 - 2012). From these results, we discuss the likely biological and ecosystem consequences in connection to the effects of climate change in the South Pacific. \n",

      "Resumen: Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus, is a merobenthic octopus whose paralarvae have been successfully cultured up to juvenile octopuses. At present, high mortality during the paralarval period prevents the scaling from experimental rearing to commercial aquaculture. The aim of the study was to determine upper (CTMax) and lower (CTMin) thermal tolerance, acclimation response ratio (ARR) and thermal tolerance polygon of paralarvae from different culture conditions and subjected to seven acclimation temperatures (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 degrees C) during the first 5 days of paralarval life. Culture conditions were two types of egg incubation (maternal care and artificial incubators) and two feeding regimes (fed or starved). Fed paralarvae showed thermal preferendum, while unfed paralarvae preferred much higher temperatures than those of acclimation. CTMin and CTMax increased along with the acclimation temperature. Lower values of ARR were obtained in paralarvae from artificial incubation, with this type of paralarva showing the least adaptability to thermal changes. Starved paralarvae showed the lowest values for thermal tolerance range (TTR) and smaller areas of thermal polygon than fed paralarvae. Rearing temperatures above 16 degrees C may be considered suboptimal to paralarvae and affected by the conditions during the embryonic incubation. Rearing temperatures below 8 degrees C may be considered suboptimal for all hatched paralarvae. Therefore, the other temperatures within this range could be used in the context of improving the culture management of paralarvae. \n",

      "Resumen: Manganese oxides of spinel structure, LiMn2O4, Li1-x Ni (x) Mn2O4 (0.25 aexae0.75), and NiMn2O4, were studied by EDS, XRD, SEM, magnetic (M-H, M-T), and XPS measurements. The samples were synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted sol-gel method. EDS analysis showed good agreement with the formulations of the oxides. XRD and Rietveld refinement of X-ray data indicate that all samples crystallize in the Fd3m space group characteristic of the cubic spinel structure. The a-cell parameter ranges from a = 8.2276 (x = 0) to a = 8.3980 (x = 1). SEM results showed particle agglomerates ranging in size from 2.3 mu m (x = 0) down to 0.8 mu m (x = 1). Hysteresis magnetization vs. applied field curves in the 5-300K range was recorded. ZFC-FC measurements indicate the presence of two magnetic paramagnetic-ferrimagnetic transitions. The experimental Curie constant was found to vary from 5 to 7.1 cm(3) K mol(-1) for the range of compositions studied (0 ae x ae 1). XPS studies of these oxides revealed the presence of Ni2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+. The experimental Ni/Mn atomic ratios obtained by XPS were in good agreement with the nominal values. A linear relationship of the average oxidation state of Mn with Ni content was observed. The oxide s cation distributions as a function of Ni content from x = 0 aEuro,Li+[Mn3+Mn4+]O-4 to x = 1 were proposed. \n",
